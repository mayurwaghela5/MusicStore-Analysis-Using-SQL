# MusicStore-Analysis-Using-SQL

Overview

In this project, we conducted an analysis of a music store database using Microsoft SQL Server. By querying the database and extracting relevant insights, we aimed to help the music store understand its business growth and make informed decisions.



Tools Used

    Since I use a MacBook, Azure Data Studio (SQL Server running with the help of docker) for querying the database. 

How to Use:
1. Import the .bacpac file in SSMS or Azure Data Studio. Run the MusicStore_Analysis.sql file to view the results.
